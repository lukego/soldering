# People

Great people to learn from on the internet!

## Twitter

Electronics twitter is a great community. People are really positive
and supportive. I share pretty much everything that I'm doing there
and it gives me a sense of community. I am very grateful for all the
people there who are sharing their expertise and experience with me.
Thank you!

## Louis Rossmann (USA)

[Louis Rossmann on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl2mFZoRqjw_ELax4Yisf6w)
runs a Macbook repair shop. He shows himself doing repairs, reviewing
equipment, and ranting about whatever crosses his mind. Seeing him
[replace BGA chips with a hot air
gun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eXMFIkdA0o) is what got me
interested in doing electronics by hand -- I had no idea this was
possible. His videos are often a bit long and rambling and that's just
his style.

I like Louis. I especially appreciate that he is business-oriented. He
judges tools and techniques based on how much they help him do his job
and generate revenue. He spends money deliberately. He won't pay
double for a luxury brand that's only 10% better but he will drop
$7500 on a BGA rework machine if that means he can reliably do
valuable repairs e.g. replacing GPUs on Macbook Pros.

I take Louis' specific equipment recommendations with a grain of salt.
He tries a few things, he uses what he happens to like, and he picks a
recommendation to sell from his store. He doesn't have an interest in
doing a more complete survey of alternatives and his equipment reviews
will be biased by his current mood or his interaction with a sales
rep. His reviews are excellent sources of information though.

## Dave Jones (AUS) aka EEVblog

[Dave Jones as EEVblog on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/EEVblog) has posted more than a
thousand videos. He is basically the Steve Irwin of electronics. He
covers topics like learning to solder, reviewing both high-end and
low-end gear, electrical engineering theory, electronics myth-busting,
equipment tear-downs, etc. He works hard and is generous with his
knowledge and experience.

I don't really follow Dave anymore. He seems most comfortable on the
analog side of things: beefy power supplies, big capacitors, high
wattage soldering irons, etc. I'm much more interested in
micro-soldering of tiny parts and their digital relationships.

## Steve Gardener (UK) aka SDG Electronics

[Steve Gardener as SDG Electronics on

buys and reviews soldering equipment. He mostly buys cheap bargains
from Banggood and opens them up and reviews important aspects like
their electrical safety. I enjoy his reviews.

Having said that, he seems to buy stuff more-or-less at random, based
on whatever is going cheap. I don't think that's a sound strategy and
I haven't been satisfied with some of the stuff I bought following his
positive reviews.

## John Gammell (USA)

[John Gammell on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/jkgamm041) is a
grand master soldering instructor. He has a bunch of minute-or-two
YouTube videos each demonstrating one soldering technique in a
masterful way.

My initial reaction to John Gammell's gorgeous work has been simply
"wow." He is definitely showing mastery of the techniques. Having said
that, the practical work that I'm doing always ends up being on much
smaller parts and in awkward tight spaces. He shows you how to drive
safely on the highway but that's different to navigating the maze of
one-way streets in a European capital...

## Jessa Jones (USA)

[Jessa Jones as iPad Rehab on
YouToube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPjp41qeXe1o_lp1US9TpWA)
does iPhone and iPad troubleshooting and repair. She has a definite
style of her own with emphasis on reworking damaged stuff. I haven't
watched many of her videos yet.

## EEVBlog community forum

[The EEVblog community forum](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/index.php)
is a treasure trove of information. There are over a million posts in
the discussion forum. The topics mostly reflect Dave Jones' own skills
and interests and opinions: he has attracted a large group of
like-minded people.

I've gradually realized that there's a bit of a mysogynistic vibe
there. Dave and the moderators like to indulge in anti-SJW rants,
pulling down the women who are succeeding in electronics, and
indulging in James Damore type diatribes. This is a shame. In other
parts of the electronics world I see a lot of leadership from women,
trans, and queer people.
