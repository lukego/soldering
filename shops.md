## Shops

Geography matters when it comes to shopping. Some things are heavy and
expensive to ship like microscopes; some have special requirements
like solder paste that has to stay refridgerated; some are just hard
to find available from shops who know how to ship things to Europe.

### Eleshop

[Eleshop.eu](https://eleshop.eu/) is my favourite supplier. They stock mostly stuff that's suited for me, their information guides and videos are great, and their prices are usually the lowest that I can find. I always check with them first and often lean towards tools that they sell.

### Batterfly

Batterfly (http://batterfly.com/) in Italy are great too. They are especially good on genuine Hakko gear for reasonable prices and quick delivery in Europe.

### Digikey and Mouser

Digi-key is where I buy the "long tail" of obscure tools because their
range is so extremely large.

Mouser is where I mostly shop for components, but Digi-key are roughly equivalent in my experience. Both delivery within days from the US for free.

### Elfa and Farnell

... There are some other shops I search when I can't find tools on Digi-key.

### Aliexpress

I used to buy a lot from Aliexpress. I've had a lot of trouble with delivery in 2020. I've started to avoid Aliexpress and pay a premium for prompt and reliable delivery instead e.g. from Amazon.de.

### Amazon.de

Amazon Germany are my first choice but they don't have much speciality items.

### Amazon.com

Amazon USA stock some items that are hard to find in Europe, like tubs
of Amtech tacky flux. Just check the seller and reviews to be sure
you're getting authentic merch.
