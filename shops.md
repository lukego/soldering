## Shops

Geography matters when it comes to shopping. Some things are heavy and
expensive to ship like microscopes; some have special requirements
like solder paste that has to stay refridgerated; some are just hard
to find available from shops who know how to ship things to Europe.

### Alfa

(Or what is that shop called again?)

### Aliexpress

I love Aliexpress. I used to shop there much more when I lived in
Switzerland, due to the low shipping and import costs, but I'm more
hesitate now that I live in Sweden. Search for what you want, sort by
number of orders, buy something that's been rated 4.7+ by 100+ people.

Or better yet get a direct link from another satisfied customer.

(I believe that Banggood is basically the same thing but I haven't
tried them.)

### Amazon.com

Amazon USA stock some items that are hard to find in Europe, like tubs
of Amtech tacky flux. Just check the seller and reviews to be sure
you're getting authentic merch.

I ordered solder paste from the Amazon US and that was probably a
mistake because I don't think it was kept refridgerated end-to-end so
I'm not sure if it will work when I finally use it.

### Amazon.de

Amazon Germany are my first choice but they don't have much speciality items.

### Batterfly

Batterfly (http://batterfly.com/) in Italy stock some specialist items
that others don't e.g. genuine Hakko soldering tips.

### Digikey and Mouser

Digikey and Mouser both stock lots of microchips and a certain amount
of equipment. They also have low minimum purchase for free shipping
(from USA?) Mouser seem more successful at delivering to Sweden
without surprising import bills.

### Farnell

Farnell have some items that others don't e.g. wire pencil.
