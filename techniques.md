## My favourite techniques

### What I do

- I use 63/37 leaded solder.
- I use the smallest tool that will get the job done. There's a [huge difference in soldering iron size](https://twitter.com/lukego/status/1296358634776076289) and smaller 0ones are much more precise.
- I solder at 280C temperature with JBC equipment and 315C with Hakko/Ersa equipment. Those are the lowest temperatures where I'm able to get consistently good results.
- I use copious amounts of Amtech tacky flux ("Louis Rossmann style.") Always. Good flux is like magic.
- I solder "small" (0603/0402/0201/01005) passives using my nano iron. I do this in batches: tin first pads, solder parts on one side, solder second side. Examples: [0402](https://twitter.com/lukego/status/1295018631487787008) and [01005](https://twitter.com/lukego/status/1297480266429210625).
- I rework small passives using nano tweezers. Example: [Reorienting 0402s](https://twitter.com/lukego/status/1294718227080261633).
- I rework small chips with pins on two sides using micro tweezers. Example: [Rotating SOP8s](https://twitter.com/lukego/status/1298648922353737728).
- Solder BGAs or chips with ground pads underneath them by tinning and fluxing the pads, placing the chip, and reflowing with hot air (like [Louis Rossmann does here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eXMFIkdA0o)). I prefer to do this with a preheater but don't always. (Occasionally I'm lazy and do other chips and passives this way too but it's so easy that it feels like cheating.)
- I solder chips by [John Gammell style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uiroWBkdFY) drag soldering and then cleaning with alcohol and kimwipes.
- I desolder chips using tweezers where possible and otherwise with hot air.

### What I want to learn

- Reworking large BGAs like GPUs and beefy FPGAs. [Louis Rossmann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1MUeZPi_kU) showed his process in detail and I want to adapt this to my purposes and tools.
- DIY stovetop vapor phase soldering. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czwRntpEzgg&t=3s

### What I don't like

- I don't do lead-free soldering. I do plan to try converting to full RoHS in the future, when I have more experience and can make an informed evaluation, likely when I start doing production work. For the moment I much prefer to work leaded at lower temperatures that give me more safety margin to avoid damaging tools and parts. Soldering at 350C feels like 
- I don't like picking small passives directly out of tape. I find it requires too much force, requires very fine tweezers, and then requires bending those tweezers back into shape. Example: [picking from tape](https://twitter.com/lukego/status/1296104751805980672) when I should probably use a vacuum tool.
- I don't like using solder paste and stencils. Just feels a bit batch-mode to me and I'm an interactive dude. I'm also cautious about leaded solder paste because it's made up of microscoping balls of lead that are likely to contaminate my workspace and body.
- I don't use ChipQuik low-temperature desoldering alloy in practice. I prefer tweezers and hot air. The ChipQuik works well and is convenient but it feels like too much hassle to thoroughly clean up to avoid contamination of other joints. I think the ChipQuik is mostly for people who don't have a hot air gun.
