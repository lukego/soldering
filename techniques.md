Various soldering and reworking techniques.

## Soldering

### Dave Jones eevblog tutorial

Dave Jones has some excellent videos about getting started with
soldering:

- [EEVblog #180 - Soldering Tutorial Part 1 - Tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5Sb21qbpEQ)
- [EEVblog #183 - Soldering Tutorial Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5Sb21qbpEQ)

I started off using lead-free solder and the cheapest tools I could
find but I've come to see the wisdom of Dave's advice. Recommended.

## Drag soldering

Great to see people making some mistakes and asking yourself what went
wrong, what would John Gammell do differently.

## Hot air

This video was mind-blowing for me. I had thought that BGA work could
only be done in batch-mode with reflow ovens and such but he just does
it casually with hot air as if he were doing a haircut.

## PCB cleaning

### John Gammell

John Gammell cleaning PCBs by applying 99% isopropyl alcohol with a
brush to dissolve flux residue, then soaking it up with a lint-free
wipe so that the residue is gone before the alcohol evaporates.

## General rework
### Jessa Jones

Jessa Jones demonstrating basic reworking techniques like soldering
with hot tweezers, leveling pads with hot air, dealing with a lifted
pad, and using tweezers in each hand to position small components.

### ChipQuik desoldering alloy

Dave Jones demonstates ChipQuik desoldering alloy, for desoldering
chips with an iron instead of a hot air gun:

(I'm surprised that Dave didn't know about ChipQuik before that video.
It's popular and has been around for a long time.)

## BGA reballing
### By hand

Using solder balls without a stencil:

Just applying fresh solder directly:

### Solder paste

Using a stencil that's probably expensive because it's strong enough
to stay in place and the tolerate heat while balls reflow:

### Solder balls

Reballing using solder balls and no stencil (holy shit):
