## Big stuff

### Soldering iron

Hakko 888D soldering station. Cost around $100 from Mouser/Digikey.
Heats up really quickly, comfortable to use, solid construction,
should last for years. Often seen recommended as a first "proper"
soldering iron.

### Hot air gun

Quick 861DW hot air rework station. Cost around $300 from Batterfly.
Seems expensive but quality seems to be excellent. Chose mostly based
on [review by Louis
Rossmann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChujyTV-HME).


### Microscope

Eakins trinocular from Aliexpress with articulating arm. (AmScope
clone.) $350 + $150 shipping. Expensive but absolutely worth every
penny!

Chose this based on the [review by Steve
Gardener](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0wRdJRzPUI) and many other
satisfied customers on YouTube and eevblog forum.

Genuine AmScope were more expensive, really hard to buy from Sweden,
often bundled with impractical mounts, and people online seemed to
like the Eakins better anyway.

### Preheater

I have a Yihua 853A preheater. I haven't actually used it yet but the
use case is assembling boards without a reflow oven, using solder
paste + preheater + hot air rework gun.

I ordered this before I needed it because it's cheap (~$45), it takes
a few weeks to be delivered from China, and the [teardown by Steve
Gardener](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHrLQ48zfOQ) convinced me
that it's decent quality and unlikely to burn my house down.

### ESD mat

I have a [120x60cm ESD
mat](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/scs/8900/SCP774-ND/9606803)
with a grounding wristband. I absolutely love it. This covers the
surface of my desk and can easily handle the heat when I solder or
rework with hot air directly on top of it.

I value the peace of mind to know that I'm not damaging chips with
static electricity when I work with them. I would hate to always live
with doubts about this while I am troubleshooting hard problems.

### Fume extractor

I have a cheap fume extractor from Aliexpress similar to [this
one](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33015679872.html). This sucks the
hazardous fumes from hot flux into a filter. I especially use it when
working with hot air and lots of flux.
