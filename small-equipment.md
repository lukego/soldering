## Small stuff
### Hakko tips

I started off with a random assortment of no-name Hakko-compatible
soldering iron tips from Amazon for around $10. These are great for
getting started and seeing which tip shapes and sizes are useful.
There seems to be a lot of individual preference here.

I since found genuine Hakko tips on Batterfly and ordered a variety of
shape D (chisel) for general use and shape BC (bevel with only flat
part tinned) for drag soldering. This was based on reading EEVblog
forum threads and seeing John Gammell also demonstrate the BC.

(I would love to try a BCM tip with resevoir but Hakko don't make that
for the 888D and I haven't found anywhere selling a compatible one.)

See [Hakko - Select Tip
Shape](https://www.hakko.com/english/tip_selection/type.html) guide.

### Tweezers

I have three pairs of good tweezers made by Ideal-Tek in Switzerland.
I love them. Chose them based on a [comment with pictures on
eevblog](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/reviews/best-tweezers-etc/msg1194495/#msg1194495).

Specifically I have the SM-108A as default choice, the fine TL 5-TA
for precise work like picking out cotton fibers from between chip
legs, and my favourite the SM-100 SA reverse-action for holding things
like solder wick steady.

These tweezers cost about $20 per pair, which seems insane for what
they are, but I am really happy with this approach of splurging on the
smaller items that bring a lot of pleasure and don't cost much in
absolute terms.

(I have some cheap $0.50 tweezers too but after accidentally launching
chips across the room a couple of times I only use those for poking
things around.)
