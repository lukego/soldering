## Small stuff

### Tips

My favourite tip shapes are the spoon (aka mini-wave), the bevel (aka
hoof), and the bent pencil or bent chisel. I also started using the
simple conical (pencil) tip with the JBC nano iron because it can
deliver heat well even with a 0.1mm tip.

I used to use chisel tips mostly. That's a good choice if you have one
iron and can't change tips easily, because the chisel is okay-ish for
most things. They also seem forgiving with basic soldering irons that
don't transfer heat well. However I'd much prefer to use a spoon/bevel
in tandem with a pencil these days.

### Tweezers

My main tweezers are reverse-action for clamping onto things (e.g. holding desoldering braid), fine straight tweezers for picking things up, and strong tweezers for opening tape. xbTODO: Add links.
