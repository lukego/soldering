# Problems and their solutions

*Solder doesn't do what I want*: more better flux.

*My hands are shaky*: relaxed posture with forearm support.

*My soldering iron is shaky*: small handpiece with short (<5cm) "grip to tip" distance.

*Small parts are sticking to my tweezers*: wash tools, boards, parts
with a flux remover. Clean parts do not stick to clean fine tweezers.

*The parts are too small*: finer tools, more magnification, better
illumination. ("There is no such thing as small parts, only poor
magnification.")

*I'm breathing in flux fumes*: Suck smoke into a fume extractor hose
or blow it away with a fan.

*Flux is polluting my working room*: Consumer HEPA filter for the room
or vent out of a window.

*I have too many Mouser/Digi-key bags*: dump parts into ~5ml jars and
label them with a short identifier e.g. "C5".

*I made a mess soldering something small*: smother in tacky flux and
reflow so that solder surface tension can do its magic.

*I have too much solder on this part*: desoldering braid to remove some
and then flux+heat to even redistribute what is left.

*I have /way/ too much solder on this part*: solder sucker to remove a big blob.

*I'm worried about thermal shock to parts from my soldering iron*: let
the parts rest on top of a ~100C preheated board. (Maybe works, maybe
doesn't, but gives me some peace of mind.)

*I don't know what soldering iron to buy*: Consider one that is
upgradable with different handpieces e.g. big and powerful, small and
precise, hot tweezers, etc so you aren't stuck with your first choice.

*I don't have enough space for all the gear I want*: You tell me!
