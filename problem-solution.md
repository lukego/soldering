# Problems and their solutions

*Solder doesn't do what I want*: more better flux.

*The parts are too small*: more magnification.

*My hands are shaky*: relaxed posture with forearm support.

*My soldering iron is shaky*: small handpiece with short (<5cm) "grip to tip" distance.

*Small parts are sticking to my tweezers*: wash tools, boards, parts with a flux remover.

*I have too many Mouser/Digi-key bags*: dump parts into ~5ml jars and label them.

*I made a mess soldering something small*: smother in tacky flux and
reflow so that solder surface tension can do its magic.

*I have too much solder on this part*: desoldering braid to remove some
and then flux+heat to even redistribute what is left.

*I have /way/ too much solder on this part*: solder sucker to remove a big blob.

*I'm worried about thermal shock to parts from my soldering iron*: let the parts rest on top of a ~100C preheated board. (Maybe works, maybe doesn't, but gives me some peace of mind.)

*I don't know what soldering iron to buy*: Consider one that is upgradable with different handpieces e.g. big and powerful, small and precise, hot tweezers, etc so you aren't stuck with your first choice.

*I don't have enough space for all the gear I want*: You tell me!
