## Consumables

### Solder

I have a 1lb spool of Kester 0.4mm (0.015") SN63PB37 leaded solder
from Amazon US. This is name-brand solder recommended by the experts.
I expect this spool to last many years.

I have since seen the [SDG
Electronics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ9wxs6xuYU) comparison
of zillions of different kinds of solder and I know that similarly
excellent solder is avaliable much cheaper too.

I also have a couple of spools of ChipQuik lead-free solder in
different thicknesses but I have switched to leaded as my default
choice based on advice from YouTubers.

### Flux

My default flux is from a 75g tub of Amtech NC-559-V2-TF tacky flux
from Amazon.com. This is what Louis Rossmann calls "the good shit" and
has a cult following who especially love it for rework. It has a gooey
consistency and seems to survive some tens of seconds under high heat
from a hot air rework station.

I have also been using ChipQuik flux, liquid from a flux pen and gel
from a tube, but I have switched to Amtech as my default. I bought a
bag of miscellaneous syringes and use one with a large tip as my
dispenser.

### Isopropyl alcohol

I use 99.5% isopropyl alcohol (aka isopropynlol, aka 2-propynol) to
clean away flux residue after soldering. I apply it using a tooth
brush.

### Kimwipes

I am currently waiting on my first delivery of Kimwipes from
Amazon.de. These are paper wipes that don't leave threads behind.
Meanwhile I'm using Q-tips which do require care to avoid leaving a
mess of cotton fibers.

### ChipQuik desoldering alloy

I have some ChipQuik desoldering alloy. It's good at what it does but I usually use hot air these days. 

### Solder balls

I have some solder balls in various sizes (for reballing BGA chips) from Aliexpress:

I haven't tried them yet but I am really looking forward to it!

### Solder paste

I have some Amtech solder paste from Amazon.com. I have this stored in
my fridge at the moment and I haven't used it yet. I'm concerned that
it spend some time (days?) in my mailbox at close to room temperature
and might be spoiled.
