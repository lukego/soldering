# About

My name is Luke and I am learning to make hardware. These are my notes
as I go along.

First I'm setting up an electronics lab and learning to solder, then I
will learn to design PCBs, then I will learn to program FPGAs.

- [People](people.md) I am learning from, mosly on YouTube.
- [Techniques](techniques.md) that I am learning, like drag soldering and BGA reballing.
- Equipment that I am using:
  - [Big equipment](big-equipment.md) like soldering irons and microscopes.
  - [Small equipment](small-equipment.md) like tips and tweezers.
  - [Consumables](consumables.md) like solder and flux.
  - [Not bought](not-bought.md) equipment that has caught my eye but I don't have.
- [Shops](shops.md) where I order what I need for delivery to Sweden.
